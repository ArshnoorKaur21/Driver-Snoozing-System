</The Driver-Snoozing-System is a machine learning system designed to detect when a driver is falling asleep at the wheel and alert them before an accident occurs. The system uses the **shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file**, which contains data about the location of 68 facial landmarks on a person's face, to analyze the driver's face and determine if they are exhibiting signs of drowsiness.</p>
